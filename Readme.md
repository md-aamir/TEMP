Library Used is changed to 90nanometer slow.lib due to fanout issues with FREEPDK45nm
Added WIRE-LOAD MODELS to the library
Area and delay of wire is incorporated by wire load models, as these models calculate length of wire using fanouts of the net
Added Analysis File to show AREA vs SLACK vs Time Period Trend
